This program displays a **Sine Wave** graph, which is very widely used in mathematics and engineering. For a better understanding, let's take a look at what this chart and the calculations it performs mean and what it does:

### Concept of sine graph:
1. **Sine function (Sin)**: The sine function is a periodic function that is used in trigonometry (trigonometric mathematics). This function converts angular inputs (in radians) to values ​​between -1 and 1.
2. **Sine graph**: The sine graph has a waveform called "sine wave". This wave is seen in many natural and physical phenomena, such as sound waves, light, and electrical oscillations.

### Practical applications:
1. **Electrical Engineering**: In electrical engineering, sine wave is used to describe AC ​​(alternating current) currents and voltages. Engineers use these diagrams to analyze electrical circuits.
2. **Communications**: In the field of communications, sine waves are the basis for describing analog signals.
3. **Signal processing**: In signal processing, sine waves are used for frequency analysis of signals.
4. **Phonology and Music**: Sound waves can also be represented as sine waves. Musical notes are produced at different frequencies that can be described by sinuses.

### Conclusion:
This program allows you to plot and visualize a sine wave. This can help you better understand wave and periodic phenomena. In various scientific and engineering fields, the ability to draw and analyze such diagrams is very useful and necessary.
